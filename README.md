# landing-page

In this project, I will be creating an entire webpage from a design that is provided to me on the odin project website. the design that is provided comes in the from of 2 images; one is the image of the complete website, and the other has details about the font and the colors used in that website. The goal is to get the project as close to the design as possible putting my knowledge of flexbox and the general foundations of css to the test.
